# Hungry Ant
#
# As a graphics program that involves making decisions, this
# program aims to simulate the behaviour of a foraging ant.  The
# ant meanders about the screen at random until either it is
# exhausted or until it finds a tasty meal.  A different message is
# displayed depending upon the outcome.
#
# The program below is a minor variant of the "step to the right"
# Turtle graphics demonstration from Lecture 4.  The
# main differences are:
#
# 1) The pen is kept up, so that no line is drawn as our "ant"
#    moves around.
#
# 2) A function and some related constants have been added to draw
#    a coloured dot on the screen representing delicious ant
#    food.
#
# Your tasks are as follows.
#
# a) Foraging ants rarely walk in perfectly straight lines.  Modify
#    the code to introduce a random "wobble" in the ant's direction
#    at each step.  Hint: Add code to do a small left or right turn
#    before the ant would normally walk straight forward.  (It's best
#    to leave the ant's behaviour alone when it's turning to avoid
#    the edge of the screen, otherwise you may create a situation
#    where the ant gets stuck randomly moving along an edge.)
#
# b) Define a Boolean-valued function that returns True if and only
#    if the ant is currently within the square representing food.
#    Hint: You will need to use the built-in xcor() and ycor()
#    functions to determine the ant's location, and the global
#    constants that fix the position and size of the food.
#
# c) Change the program so that it recognises when the ant has
#    wandered onto the food.  In this case the ant should stop and
#    the message "Yum, yum!" should be displayed on the screen.
#    Hint: You will need to use the built-in write() function to
#    print text in the drawing window.  Also, note that Python's
#    "break" command causes the program to exit the current loop
#    immediately, so can be used to terminate the "for" loop.
#
# d) As a further refinement, you should get the ant to say "I give
#    up!" if all of the "steps" have been completed and the food
#    has not been found.  Hint: You will need a way of remembering
#    whether the loop ended because the food was found or because
#    the ant has completed the specified number of steps.
